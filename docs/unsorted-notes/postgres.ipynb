    "PGHOST behaves the same as the host connection parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "PGHOSTADDR behaves the same as the hostaddr connection parameter. This can be set instead of or in addition to PGHOST to avoid DNS lookup overhead.\n",

    "PGDATABASE behaves the same as the dbname connection parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "PGUSER behaves the same as the user connection parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "PGPASSWORD behaves the same as the password connection parameter. Use of this environment variable is not recommended for security reasons, as some operating systems allow non-root users to see process environment variables via ps; instead consider using the ~/.pgpass file (see Section 31.14).\n",
    "\n",
    "PGPASSFILE specifies the name of the password file to use for lookups. If not set, it defaults to ~/.pgpass (see Section 31.14).\n",

    "\n",
    "PGSERVICEFILE specifies the name of the per-user connection service file. If not set, it defaults to ~/.pg_service.conf (see Section 31.15).\n",
    "\n",
    "PGREALM sets the Kerberos realm to use with PostgreSQL, if it is different from the local realm. If PGREALM is set, libpq applications will attempt authentication with servers for this realm and use separate ticket files to avoid conflicts with local ticket files. This environment variable is only used if Kerberos authentication is selected by the server.\n",

    "PGSYSCONFDIR sets the directory containing the pg_service.conf file and in a future version possibly other system-wide configuration files.\n",
